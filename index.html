											<h1>Hi, I’m Bijaya Luitel.<br />
											</h1>
											<p>I'm a rising sophomore at Yale-NUS College, slated to graduate in May, 2023.</p>
										</header>
										<p>I am a Physical Sciences major with an interest in Astronomy and Physics. My freshman year was filled with courses mostly in our college's common curriculum; we studied literary texts in Literature and Humanities, philosophical texts in Philosophy and Political Thought, papers in the social sciences in Comparative Social Inquiry and learnt basic statistics and visualization using R in Quantitative Reasoning. Apart from my common curriculum classes, I took Calculus and Intro to Black Holes.</p>
										<p> For my final project in Intro to Black Holes, I wrote a short fictional account of a civilization living on a planet around Sagittarius A*. Its not very nice at the moment, but I'm looking to adapt it into something more worthwhile. Have a look in the meantime!

											<p>I'm currently doing research on star formation in the early universe, with Dr. Chelsea Sharon at Yale-NUS College. My research is devoted to one gravitionally lensed galaxy called the Cosmic Eye, which is about 11 billion years away from us. We are trying to resolve the Carbon Monoxide line for this galaxy in order to derive interesting properties about the galaxy's star formation rate. The above plot is taken from "A very bright, highly magnified Lyman break galaxy at z = 3.07 published" in January 2007 by Smail et. al.</p>

											<p>I'm from Nepal, was born in Kathmandu Valley and spent three memorable years of my childhood in Australia. I was educated in the CBSE Board, under the Indian Government until Grade 10 (the equivalent of high school sophomore year). After that, I completed my pre-college education by doing a Cambridge International A-levels course. During my A-levels, I participated in and obtained honourable mentions at the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics for two-years running, which has helped formed the bulk of my knowledge in astronomy. </center>
